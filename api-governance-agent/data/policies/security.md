# Security Best Practices

- **Rule 4.1:** All data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Rule 4.2:** Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, command injection).
- **Rule 4.3:** Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Rule 4.4:** Rate limiting must be implemented to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Rule 4.5:** APIs must not expose sensitive data in GET requests.
